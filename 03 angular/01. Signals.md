# Signals in Angular

## What are Signals in Angular?

Signals in Angular are a reactive primitive introduced to handle state management more efficiently. They allow developers to manage and track changes to values in a reactive and fine-grained manner, reducing unnecessary computations and improving performance.

Signals provide:

- **Automatic Dependency Tracking**: Signals track dependencies automatically and update only when the value changes.
- **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Instead of triggering an entire component re-render, only the dependent parts update.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces the need for manual state management using RxJS.

## Creating and Using Signals

### 1. Basic Usage of Signals

First, import `signal` from `@angular/core` and define a signal:

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-signal-example",
  template: `<p>Count: {{ count() }}</p>
    <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>`,
})
export class SignalExampleComponent {
  count = signal(0);

  increment() {
    this.count.set(this.count() + 1);
  }
}
```

### 2. Computed Signals

Computed signals allow derived values based on other signals.

```typescript
import { computed, signal } from "@angular/core";

const baseValue = signal(10);
const doubleValue = computed(() => baseValue() * 2);

console.log(doubleValue()); // Output: 20
```

### 3. Effects in Signals

Effects automatically run when signal values change.

```typescript
import { effect, signal } from "@angular/core";

const count = signal(0);

effect(() => {
  console.log(`Count changed to: ${count()}`);
});

count.set(5); // Triggers effect
```

### 4. Using Signals in a Service

```typescript
import { Injectable, signal } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class CounterService {
  count = signal(0);

  increment() {
    this.count.set(this.count() + 1);
  }
}
```

### 5. Signal-Based Component Interaction

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: `<p>Child Count: {{ count() }}</p>`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() count!: Signal<number>;
}
```

## Conclusion

Signals offer an efficient and reactive way to manage state in Angular applications. They reduce reliance on RxJS for simple state management and provide better performance through fine-grained reactivity.
