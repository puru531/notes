# Dependency Injection in Angular

Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern and mechanism where:

1. Instead of creating service instances manually inside components
   BAD APPROACH:

```ts
private tasksService = new TasksService();
```

2. We declare dependencies in the constructor and Angular provides instances
   GOOD APPROACH:

```ts
constructor(private tasksService: TasksService) {}
```

3. Services can be injected using constructor injection

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // Makes service available app-wide
})
export class TasksService {
  // Service implementation
}
```

4. Or using the inject() function (Alternative approach)

```ts
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class TaskComponent {
  private tasksService = inject(TasksService);
}
```

Benefits of DI:

- Promotes loose coupling between components and dependencies
- Makes code more testable through dependency mocking
- Enables sharing singleton instances across components
- Angular handles object creation and lifecycle management
- Allows for easier dependency replacement and configuration
  Component file :

```typescript
  // private tasksService = new TasksService();

  // this will create a new instance of the service
  // which is not what we want
  // we want to use the same instance of the service
  // that is provided by Angular

  constructor(private tasksService: TasksService) {}

  // this process is known as Dependency Injection.
  // You tell Angular which type of value you need and Angular created it and provides it as an argument


  onAddTask(task: Newtask) {
    this.tasksService.addTask(task, this.userId);
    this.isAddingTask = false;
  }
```

Service File :

```typescript
// Services in Angular are classes that can be shared across components
// They are used for:
// 1. Sharing data between components
// 2. Implementing application logic
// 3. Making HTTP calls
// Here's an example of a basic service:

import { Newtask } from "./task/task.model";

import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // This makes the service available throughout the app
})
export class TasksService {
  // A service is generally a class.

  addTask(taskData: Newtask, userId: string) {
    this.tasks.push({
      id: new Date().getTime().toString(),
      userId: userId,
      title: taskData.title,
      summary: taskData.summary,
      dueDate: taskData.date,
    });
  }
}
```

### Other way of injecting service in component:

```typescript
// Another way to inject a service is using the 'inject' function
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class TaskComponent {
  private tasksService = inject(TasksService);

  onAddTask(task: Newtask) {
    this.tasksService.addTask(task, this.userId);
    this.isAddingTask = false;
  }
}
```

## Introduction

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in Angular that allows classes to receive dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. It improves modularity, testability, and maintainability.

This guide covers DI in Angular from beginner to advanced levels with practical examples.

---

## 1. Basic Dependency Injection

Angular provides built-in DI using the `@Injectable` decorator.

### Example: Injecting a Simple Service

#### Step 1: Create a Service

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class LoggerService {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log("LoggerService:", message);
  }
}
```

Here, `providedIn: 'root'` makes the service available throughout the application.

#### Step 2: Inject the Service in a Component

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { LoggerService } from "./logger.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: '<button (click)="logMessage()">Log Message</button>',
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private logger: LoggerService) {}

  logMessage() {
    this.logger.log("Hello from AppComponent!");
  }
}
```

Here, `LoggerService` is injected into the `AppComponent` constructor.

---

## 2. Intermediate Level - Injecting Dependencies in Services

You can inject services into other services.

### Example: Service Inside Another Service

#### Step 1: Create a Data Service

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return ["Angular", "React", "Vue"];
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Inject `DataService` into Another Service

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { DataService } from "./data.service";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class ProductService {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  fetchProducts() {
    return this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

Now `ProductService` depends on `DataService`.

---

## 3. Advanced Level - Multi-Providers and Injection Tokens

### Providing Different Implementations

You can provide multiple implementations for a service using `InjectionToken`.

#### Step 1: Create an Injection Token

```typescript
import { InjectionToken } from "@angular/core";

export const API_URL = new InjectionToken<string>("apiUrl");
```

#### Step 2: Provide and Inject the Token

```typescript
import { Component, Inject } from "@angular/core";
import { API_URL } from "./api.token";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: "<p>API URL: {{ apiUrl }}</p>",
  providers: [{ provide: API_URL, useValue: "https://api.example.com" }],
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(API_URL) public apiUrl: string) {}
}
```

This technique is useful for providing environment-specific configurations.

## Conclusion

- DI in Angular enhances modularity and testability.
- Services can be injected into components and other services.
- Using `InjectionToken` allows flexibility for dependency management.
- Multi-providers and custom providers offer advanced DI patterns.

Mastering Angular's DI system helps build scalable applications efficiently.
